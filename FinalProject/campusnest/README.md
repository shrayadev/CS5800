# CampusNest

CampusNest is a student-focused off-campus housing platform built to simplify the housing search experience for Cal Poly Pomona students. Traditional platforms like Craigslist and Facebook lack the structure, safety, and filtering tools students need when searching for housing. CampusNest addresses these issues by offering:

- Verified and student-relevant listings
- Filter options based on rent, distance from campus, room type, and amenities
- The ability to save favorite listings locally
- A built-in application status tracker (e.g., Interested, Applied, Leased)
- Honest reviews from other students in the campus community
- A simple, responsive interface designed specifically with student usability in mind

CampusNest is a full-stack web application that demonstrates how modern web development can be applied to solve practical student problems effectively.
